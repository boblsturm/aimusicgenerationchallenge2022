# The Ai Music Generation Challenge 2022

### Reels in the Style of O’Neill’s 1001
 
## What?
Build an artificial system that generates the most plausible reels, as judged against the 350 published in F. O’Neill “The Dance Music of Ireland: O’Neill’s 1001” (1907). Up to two prizes will be awarded, and performances of the best ones will occur at some point 2022 in both Sweden and Ireland. The panel of judges consists of four (human) experts in Irish traditional music and performance.

The 2022 challenge is part of a project that has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant agreement No. 864189 [MUSAiC: Music at the Frontiers of Artificial Creativity and Criticism](https://www.kth.se/is/tmh/speech-communication/musaic-music-at-the-frontiers-of-artificial-creativity-and-criticism-1.950539)).
 
## Why?
This challenge has three aims:
1. to promote meaningful approaches to evaluating music Ai;
2. to see how music Ai research can benefit from traditional music, and how traditional music can benefit from music Ai research;
3. to facilitate discussions about the ethics of music Ai research applied to traditional music practices.

## How?
1. By JULY 4, register your intent to participate by notifying the [organizer](mailto:bobs@kth.se?subject=Participation-in-the-Ai-Music-Generation-Challenge-2022).
2. Build a system that generates reels.
3. Have your system generate 1000 reels rendered as MIDI and in notation (such as ABC, musicXML, or staff).
4. Write a brief technical document describing how you built your system, presenting some of its features and outcomes, and linking to your code and models for reproducibility.
5. By OCTOBER 7, email the [organizer](mailto:bobs@kth.se):
- a link to download your generated collection of 1000 reels rendered as MIDI **and** in notation (such as ABC, musicXML, or staff).
- a link to download your technical document (pdf)
- one reel in your collection that you want included in the evaluation (choose what you think is the best).
6. Only one submission from each participant will be allowed.

## Evaluation
The evaluation of submissions will proceed in the following way:
1. From each submitted collection, one tune is selected by the participant of the collection, and a number of others are selected at random.
3. All selected tunes are sent to all judges for review.
4. _Stage 1_ Each judge reviews the acceptability of each tune according to the following:
- If plagiarism detected, reject and do not review.
- If rhythm is not characteristic of a reel, reject and do not review.
- If mode and accidentals are not characteristic of a reel, reject and do not review.
5. _Stage 2_ Each judge will rate on a scale of 1–5 the acceptable tunes along the following qualities:
- Structure
- Melody
6. _Stage 3_ Each judge will present to the other judges the best tunes from their collections, and together will decide which are the best reel (or to award no prize).
